📦 Lens Expert (LENS) — NLP Utility Suite
LENS (Language & Expression eXpert) is a user-friendly, Streamlit-powered web application that brings the power of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) together to perform a variety of text analysis tasks — all in one place.
This application provides tools like Language Detection, Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis, Spam Classification, and a News Classifier (under development) — making it a handy utility for text classification and analysis tasks.

🎯 Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to provide an intuitive, accessible, and efficient platform where anyone can perform common NLP tasks without diving deep into the technical complexities. Whether you're a researcher, student, or just curious about how text classification works, Lens Expert allows you to explore these functionalities through a simple interface.
